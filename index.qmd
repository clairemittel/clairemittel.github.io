Hi! My name is Claire and I'm a third year Ecosystem Science and Sustainability major with a minor in Conservation Biology. I have a huge passion for the outdoors and love to hike, camp, and fly fish. Usually, you can find me reading a book, I do that whenever I have any free time. My passion in sustainability is specifically in sustainable fashion and beauty products.
