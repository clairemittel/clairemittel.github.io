## About

I have a specific interest in sustainable fashion and beauty because I have always had an interest in that industry. I am incredibly passionate about sustainability and I think that incorporating both with each other would be my dream job, as well as making it something that is attainable for everyone.

## What I do for work

Currently I am a part-time personal assistant to a wheelchair-bound CSU staff member.

## What I do for fun

I love to read, it is something that I do often in my free time. I also love to watch all the shows and movies that I can, as I love pop culture and everything about it. I have a passion for the outdoors, so I camp, hike, and fly fish as much as I can.
